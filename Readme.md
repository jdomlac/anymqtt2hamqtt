# anymqtt2hamqtt

(Any MQTT to HomeAssistant MQTT)

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a Master's subject in Computer Engineering and Networks (UPV, Valencia). The project will not be further developed, but if anyone finds it interesting, contributions are welcomed.
TODO: Actual project description and main goals

## Features

- **Multiple MQTT Streams into a single HomeAssistant instance**: The MQTT Addon for HomeAssistant only supports one entity at the moment, thus, only one MQTT broker. This application properly merges multiple MQTT streams into HomeAssistant.
- **Add autodiscovery to unsupported devices**: With little coding, your unsupported devices will get MQTT autodiscovery working on HomeAssistant.
